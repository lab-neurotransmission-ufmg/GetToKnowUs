# GetToKnowUs
Welcome to the ICB-UFMG's Neurotransmission Laboratory GitHub Profile!

We are a scientific research group at the Institute of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Minas Gerais (ICB-UFMG), dedicated to advancing our understanding of neurotransmission mechanisms, neurochemistry, and their implications in health and disease.

This space hosts the open-source code, tools, and pipelines developed and used in our cutting-edge research. Here, you’ll find resources for data analysis, computational models, and experimental protocols designed to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in neuroscience.

We believe in the power of open science! Feel free to explore, adapt, or contribute to our projects. If you have questions or collaboration ideas, email us or visit our institutional website.

Together, let’s decode the complexities of the brain.
